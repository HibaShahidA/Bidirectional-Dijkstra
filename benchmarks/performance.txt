# Performance graphs here

The performance graphs show the trend:

Worst performance: standard Dijkstra
Moderate performance: A*
Best performance: bidirectional Dijkstra

Shows that it is, in fact, instance optimal.

Larger graphs -> bidirectional Dijkstra treverses lesser nodes/vertices -> shorter execution time.
